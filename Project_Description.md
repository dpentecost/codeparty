#CodeParty! - A Social Guide to GitHub and the Coding Universe 

##Project Abstract: 

CodeParty! is a series of informal and interactive workshops at the Lower Eastside Girls Club that are designed to introduce girls and young women to GitHub, build upon their coding skills, and expose them to the fun nature of coding by adding collaborative games and game building to step by step tutorials. Knowledge of GitHub, an online shared repository for projects of all kinds, is essential for young coders and the organizations who encourage them. The curriculum created in this project will be shared with youth digital media learning organizations through GitHub itself and through tutorial sites such as Mozilla’s Webmaker pages.

##Project Partners: 

We intend to work with Code Ed, who will be our partners in coding classes in the next year, to review the exercises we develop and advise on deployment. Once the the curriculum has been deployed and tested in our location we will ask Mozilla to help disseminate it on its Webmaker tutorial pages.

##Audience Served: 

This project will target girls and young women from low-income communities throughout the five boroughs, and in particular, the Lower East Side. While Lower East Side has gentrified in recent years, the youth population in the Lower East Side, serviced by LESGC, remains “most-in-need”, with a high proportion of Hispanic, Black, Economically Disadvantaged and English Language Learner students.


##Project Description and Results: 

##Why GitHub?

For coders, GitHub is the water they swim in, the corner they hang out, the place where they share and collaborate. GitHub is the place where millions of coders and non-coders share their work and collaborate.

But for all the tutorials on Git and GitHub that are out there online, there are none for the younger coders. The “Here is how you do it” approach does not convey why you would want to do it, and how much fun it can be to create something in a collaborative environment. 

For an individual student, a personal repository opens up the universe of coding and open source software.  

For a youth technology organization, a shared GitHub repository should be the first thing that is built by a coding or maker class in order to save work and add to it. 

A CodeParty will create a shared GitHub repository where they will build upon it throughout the course. In each class, participants will be broken out into teams of 3 or 4 members and they will work through a series of fun exercises in sharing, adding and improving upon each other’s work. 

CodeParty! will produce a series of collaborative projects utilizing GitHub:

* Text story or rhyme
* Drawing
* Tune/Composition
* Game (Example: Unity game engine)
* Code Exercise (Example: Scratch)
* Web Page

The final products will be turned into accessible instructions online, and publicized through Mozilla.  And of course, placed in a repository on GitHub! A collection of links to other tutorials will be added to the online series, and  suggestions for useful and fun repositories that girls can browse and try out to add to their understanding and advance their coding skills. 

##Learning Strategies: 

* Blended Environment
* Production Centered
* Openly Networked
* Peer-Education /Performance

##Learning Principles:  

* Interest powered
* Peer-Supported
* Academically Oriented

CodeParty! is designed to foster critical thinking, creative problem solving and resilience, strengthen digital literacy, design and their ability to collaborate effectively and efficiently. The overall aim is to empower girls and young women to explore collaborative code  while simultaneously sharing best practices and designing a replicable program model which can be administered across the country.

##Participant Snapshot:

The CodeParty! project will design a series of after-school classes at the LESGC. Classes will be offered four times a week in four 8-week sessions throughout the year. Classes are designed to empower girls to explore the universe of GitHub and add collaborative games and game building to simple, clear GitHub tutorials. 

##Open Digital Media Technologies: 

GitHub itself is a major tool for open software development. Its use is common to projects that span a wide variety of code choices. Other tools that will be used in CodeParty collaborative exercises include HTML, Javascript, Scratch, and in the case of Unity game scripts, the C# language. Unity, while not open source itself, is a free download (for Mac, Windows, Linux) and can be used in cross-platform game creation. It also has a strong representation on GitHub, where users share their creations freely.
